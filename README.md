-Converting Homework Project-

I took machine learning course given by Andrew Ng ( https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome ). Assignment of the course was old, was written Octave but they were very useful to learn inside of ML classes (you may need them during debug) and also  exciting projects like image compression, spam classification, digit recognition, etc. After taking the course, I converted all projects to python. After converting, I have been coding them today python classes.

During the course, only part of homework project were completed by student. I kept this part by same comment.

Training data or other documents that were using on code added (generally mat files), too.

Thank you very much Dr. Andrew Ng for this excellent course and its materials.
